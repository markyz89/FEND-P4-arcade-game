# Arcade Game Classic



This is a version of the classic arcade game 'Frogger' created as part of the Udacity Front End Nanodegree programme. The game utilises HTML, CSS and Javascript to create an object orientated game with collisions.

## Instructions


Load the game by running the index.html file in a browser.

Your player is the character located at the bottom of the game area. To move your player, you can use the arrow keys on your keyboard.

The object of the game is to get the character from the grass, across the three rows of tiles and into the water. Unfortunately, a horde of cockroaches patrol these tiles, and coming into contact with any of them will send your character back to the starting point. You must avoid the cockroaches if you want to reach the water!

Once you reach the water, the game restarts with your character back in the starting position, ready to play again.




## Contributing 

This is an assessed project for the Udacity Nanodegree programme so I will most likely not be accepting pull requests as that would probably be considered cheating.

## Acknowledgements

The game's engine.js file and resources.js file were built by the good people at Udacity, making this project possible.
